\fB\-t\fR DAY:NIGHT
Color temperature to set at daytime/night
.PP
The neutral temperature is 6500K. Using this value will not
change the color temperature of the display. Setting the
color temperature to a value higher than this results in
more blue light, and setting a lower value will result in
more red light.
.PP
Default values:
.IP
Daytime temperature: 5500K
Night temperature: 3700K
